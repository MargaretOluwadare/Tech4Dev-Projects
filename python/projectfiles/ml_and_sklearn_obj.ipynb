    "Machine learning is the process of asking computers to do something without being explicitlly told how to do it.\n",
    "There are four types of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1). Supervised Learning: This is when a machine is trained on a data that has feature variables and target vector. they can be further classified into two\n",
    "\n",
    "a). Classification: When the machine is trained on categorical data. e.g creating a model that predict if it will rain or not. it is also divided into two, \n",
    "\n",
    "i). Binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "ii). Multiclass classification\n",
    "\n",
    "b). Regression: When the machine is trained on numerical data. e.gcreating a model that predict house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2). Unsupervised Learning: This is when a machine is trained on only feature variables, that is we do not have a particular target vector we want to predict. example includes Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "3). Transfer Learning: This is when machine is trained on an existing model\n",
    "\n",
    "4). Reinforcement Learning: This is when a machine is trained by itself, that is rewarding it when it is good and punishing it when it is bad"
